# my-postgraduate-study
my assignment during postgraduate years

Hello my net name is Hibari
I am a post graduate student in China majored in Acoutic Engineering
Oh, I hate my major because I was forced to choose it

This repository contains all the code mainly by Matlab that
my professor order me to do during my post graduate years

It is ok to use it for free and any use that is not commercial
even if you want to use it for your assignment is permitted 
and do not need to ask my permission

I mainly speak Chinese, also a little English and a littel Japanese
so the report will be in Chinese

My working field is about beamforming, underwater signal processing,
and ADCP and so on
so what may have in this repository will be something in that field
